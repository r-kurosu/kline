Write the abstract here.
Unfortunately, if you want a master's degree, you must write the abstract of your master thesis
in English (in addition to the Japanese one) even if you write your thesis in Japanese.
However, if you are going to get a bachelor's degree (not a master's degree),
you don't need to do so.
Good luck!!
